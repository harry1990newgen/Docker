## 🔹 What Is Docker?

Docker is a **platform that packages applications** along with everything they need  
(libraries, system tools, configurations) into **lightweight, portable containers**.

A **container** is a small, isolated environment that ensures your application  
**runs exactly the same** no matter where it is deployed — on your laptop, server,  
or any cloud platform.

- ⚡ Makes **deployment faster** and more consistent  
- 🧩 Uses **fewer resources** than traditional virtual machines  
- 🔒 Allows multiple apps to run in **isolated environments** on the same host
